The renminbi (abbreviation: RMB; Chinese: 人民币; pinyin: Rénmínbì; lit. 'People's Currency'; symbol: 元/圆/¥; code: CNY) is the official currency of the People's Republic of China and one of the world's reserve currencies, ranking as the eighth most traded currency in the world as of April 2019.[2]

The yuan (Chinese: 元; pinyin: yuán or simplified Chinese: 圆; traditional Chinese: 圓; pinyin: yuán) is the basic unit of the renminbi, but the word is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts. One yuan divides into 10 jiao (Chinese: 角; pinyin: jiǎo), and a jiao in turn divides into 10 fen (Chinese: 分; pinyin: fēn). The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China.[3]
