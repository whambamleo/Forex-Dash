The Swiss franc (German: Franken, French: franc, Italian: franco and Romansh: franc; sign: Fr. (in German language), fr. (in French, Italian, Romansh languages), or CHF in any other language, or internationally;[1] code: CHF) is the currency and legal tender of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It is also legal tender in the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia.[6] The Swiss National Bank (SNB) issues banknotes and the federal mint Swissmint issues coins.

The smaller denomination, a hundredth of a franc, is a Rappen (Rp.) in German, centime (c.) in French, centesimo (ct.) in Italian, and rap (rp.) in Romansh. The ISO 4217 code of the currency is CHF, which is used by banks and financial institutions.

The official symbols Fr. (German symbol) and fr. (Latin languages) are widely used by businesses and advertisers, also for the English language. According to Art. 1 SR/RS 941.101 of the federal law collection the internationally official abbreviation – besides the national languages – however is CHF,[1] also in English; respective guides also request to use the ISO 4217 code.[5][2][3][4] The use of SFr. for Swiss Franc and fr.sv. are outdated.[2][3][4] The Latinate "CH" stands for Confoederatio Helvetica. Given the different languages used in Switzerland, Latin is used for language-neutral inscriptions on its coins.
